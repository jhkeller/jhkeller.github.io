Supply Drop - Rust
---
This has been looooong over due. I can't remember when i first made the original supply drop for Rust. But boy, did it need doing! Here's the updated version. I sort of mixed a couple of different types of supply drops together to try and make something a bit unique. Oh, in the 3d viewer - the tarp looks a bit sweaty...ignore that!
