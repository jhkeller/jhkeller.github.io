Handheld Console Concept - Rust Hackweek
---
This was for one my previous hackweeks. I really loved the idea of being able to pick these consoles off of dead scientists that you come across in Rust and to be able to find and collect more games across the map.
Concept and design process by me in a week. Wish i had more time for this!
