Hatchet & Pickaxe Skins - Rust
---
These are 2 of the tool skins for the new Rust Lumberjack DLC pack - the Hatchet and Pickaxe skins! Really enjoyed working on these from the concept by Paul Bradley - I have recorded (most of) the process but haven't had time to put it all together so i'll probably post the link to my twitter. Hope you're enjoying the new skins!
