Spas 12 Remake - Rust
---
I had about a week or so of "free time" in between assigned tasks so i decided to remake the old spas model we were using in Rust. I felt like we needed to have a refresh. So here we are. It was super fun going into a lot of detail on the model, especially on the internal parts and coming to a better understanding how it worked. Sadly, they discontinued the spas model - it's such an iconic weapon.
